How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area contains only the files to be commited, while the working directory 
    contains all of the files in the repository. This allows you to commit certain
    files rather than all of the files in the repositry.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    Using git diff --staged will show the difference between what you have in your
    staging area and the latest commit.

organized? How would branches help?

    yet want to include in the official version of your project, so this way you
    can retain a working version of your project while working on other ideas separately
    without affecting the offical version.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    the way we do because the new commit now actually points to two different parents
    that used to be the actual branches.
