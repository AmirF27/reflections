When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you're collaborating with other people for example.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because when working with others, you often don't want their changes to be pulled
    automatically to your local repository. When each person is working on a separate
    feature, for example, this might cause some unwanted issues.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

     - Clones are a copy of the entire repository, along with the commit log. I would
       use them to clone a repository to my machine from either an online or local
       source.
     - Forks are a GitHub feature, and they basically clone someone else's repository
       to your account, all on their own servers. I would use them when I want to 
       contribute to someone's repository and I don't have permission to do so 
       (provided they agree to it).
     - Branches are just labels that are attached to certain commits. I would use 
       them when I want to work on an experimental feature, or some feature that 
       I don't want in the official version of the project just yet. Another case 
       where I would use branches is when I'm working with someone else on the same 
       project and each of us is working on a separate feature.
