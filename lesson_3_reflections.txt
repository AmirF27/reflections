When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you're collaborating with other people for example.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because when working with others, you often don't want their changes to be pulled
    automatically to your local repository. When each person is working on a separate
    feature, for example, this might cause some unwanted issues.
